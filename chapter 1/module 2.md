# Module 2: Understand the Risk Management Process

### **Risk ðŸ“Š**

**Risk Management** - process, and each organization makes its own determination of what constitutes risk and the level of risk it is willing to accept.

**Risk** - measure of the extent to which entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event. Combination of:

1. the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs, and
2. the likelihood of occurrence

**Information Security Risk** - the potential adverse impacts that result from the possibility of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of information and/or information system

**Vulnerability** - a gap or weakness in an organizationâ€™s protection of its valuable assets, including information.

**Threats** - something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access

### **Risk Management Terminology ðŸ“‡**

**Assets** -  Something in need of protection. Anything of value that is owned by an organization. Assets include both tangible items such as information systems and physical property and intangible assets such as intellectual property.

**Vulnerability** - a gap or weaknesses in those protection efforts. Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source. NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1

**Threats** - something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability to thwart protection efforts. Any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations (including mission, functions, image or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other organizations or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information and/or denial of service. NIST SP 800-30 Rev 1

**Threat actors** - an individual or a group that attempts to exploit vulnerabilities to cause or force a threat to occur. This include: 

- Insider (human error or incompetent)
- Outside individuals or informal groups ( planned or opportunistic in discovering vulnerabilities)
- Formal entities that are nonpolitical (business competitors and cybercriminals)
- Formal entities that are political (terrorist, nation-states, hacktivist)
- Intelligence or information gatherers
- Technology (free-running bots and AI)
    
    **Bots** - malicious code that acts remotely controlled robot for an attacker with Trojan and worms capabilities
    
    **AI** - ability of bots and computers to simulate human intelligent and behavior
    
    Threat Vector - threats actor carries out their objectives
    

**Likelihood** - 

### **Risk Assessment** ðŸ§¨

**Definition of Risk Assessment:**

- Process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks to an organizationâ€™s operations, assets, individuals, and more.

**Alignment with Organizational Goals:**

- Results in aligning identified risks with the organizationâ€™s goals, objectives, assets, or processes.

**Common Risk Assessment Example:**

- Illustration of a risk assessment activity related to the risk of fire in a building.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Discussion of various mitigation strategies for the example risk (e.g., fire alarms, sprinkler systems, gas-based systems).

**Primary Goal**

- The primary goal of a risk assessment is to estimate and prioritize risks.

**Documenting Results:**

- The result of the risk assessment is often documented as a report or presentation for management.

**Management Decision-Making:**

- Management uses the report to prioritize identified risks and determine suitable mitigation methods.

**Possible Follow-up Actions:**

- Management may indicate a need for a more in-depth or detailed risk assessment by internal or external resources.

Overall, risk assessment is a strategic process aimed at understanding and managing risks to ensure the protection of organizational assets and goals.

### **Risk Treatment** ðŸ©¹

Definition:

- the determination of the best way to identify or address risk

Risk tolerance:

- how much risk organization willing to accept

Risk avoidance:

- Risk avoidance is the decision to attempt to eliminate the risk entirely.
- This could include ceasing operation for some or all of the activities of the organization that are exposed to a particular risk.
- Organization leadership may choose risk avoidance when the potential impact of a given risk is too high or if the likelihood of the risk being realized is simply too great.

Risk acceptance:

- Risk acceptance is taking no action to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring.
- Management may opt for conducting the business function that is associated with the risk without any further action on the part of the organization,
- either because the impact or likelihood of occurrence is negligible, or because the benefit is more than enough to offset that risk.

Risk mitigation:

- Risk mitigation is the most common type of risk management and includes taking actions to prevent or reduce the possibility of a risk event or its impact.
- Mitigation can involve remediation measures, or controls, such as security controls, establishing policies, procedures, and standards to minimize adverse risk.
- Risk cannot always be mitigated, but mitigations such as safety measures should always be in place.

Risk transfer:

- Risk transference is the practice of passing the risk to another party, who will accept the financial impact of the harm resulting from a risk being realized in exchange for payment.
- Typically, this is an insurance policy.

### Risk Priorities âœ¨

Identification of Risks

- After identifying risks, the next step is to prioritize and analyze them.

Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis

- Security professionals use both qualitative and quantitative analysis to understand and assess risks.

Contextual understanding

- Understanding the organizationâ€™s overall mission and functions helps place risks in context, determine root causes, and prioritize assessments.

Management Direction

- Management provides direction on using risk assessment findings to determine a prioritized set of risk-response actions.

Risk Matrix

- The use of a risk matrix is an effective method for prioritizing risks based on the intersection of likelihood of occurrence and impact.

Common Language for Communication

- A risk matrix provides a common language for teams to communicate with management regarding final priorities.

Factors influencing priority

- Priority assignment may consider factors such as business priorities, the cost of mitigating a risk, or the potential for loss in case of an incident.

### Risk Tolerance âš”

Definition:

- level of risk that entity willing to assume/take in order to achieve a potential desired result

Who determine risk tolerance?

- executive management
- board of director
