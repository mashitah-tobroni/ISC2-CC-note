# Module 2: Understand System Hardening

- Hardening - the process of applying secure configurations (to reduce the attack surface) and locking down various hardware, communications systems and software, including the operating system, web server, application server and applications

### ****Configuration Management Overview****

- a process and discipline used to ensure that the only changes made to a system are those that have been authorized and validated
- a decision-making process AND set of control processes

- Identification - Baseline identification of a system and all its components, interfaces and documentation.
- Baseline - A security baseline is a minimum level of protection that can be used as a reference point. Baselines provide a way to ensure that updates to technology and architectures are subjected to the minimum understood and acceptable level of security requirements.
- Change control - An update process for requesting changes to a baseline, by means of making changes to one or more components in that baseline. A review and approval process for all changes. This includes updates and patches.
- Verification & Audit - A regression and validation process, which may involve testing and analysis, to verify that nothing in the system was broken by a newly applied set of changes. An audit process can validate that the currently in-use baseline matches the sum total of its initial baseline plus all approved changes applied in sequence.
