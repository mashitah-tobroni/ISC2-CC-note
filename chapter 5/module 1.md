# Module 1: Understand Data Security

### Data Handling

- data security life cycle model can align easily with different roles
- Data Handling Deeper Dive
- Some of the data handling based on regulatory gov requirement and data security standard

- Create - Creating the knowledge, which is usually tacit knowledge at this point.
- Store - Storing or recording it in some fashion (which makes it explicit).
- Use - Using the knowledge, which may cause the information to be modified, supplemented or partially deleted.
- Share - Sharing the data with other users, whether as a copy or by moving the data from one location to another.
- Archive - Archiving the data when it is temporarily not needed.
- Destroy - Destroying the data when it is no longer needed.

### Data Handling Practices

- Classification - process of recognizing the organizational impacts if the information suffers any security compromises related to its characteristics of confidentiality, integrity and availability
    - derived from laws, regulations, contract-specified standards or business expectations
- Labeling - a simple way of assigning a level of sensitivity to a data asset, such that the higher the level, the greater the presumed harm to the organization, and thus the greater security protection the data asset requires
    - part of implementing controls to protect classified information
    - classification:
        - Highly restricted: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could possibly put the organization’s future existence at risk. Compromise could lead to substantial loss of life, injury or property damage, and the litigation and claims that would follow.
        - Moderately restricted: Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could lead to loss of temporary competitive advantage, loss of revenue or disruption of planned investments or activities.
        - Low sensitivity (sometimes called “internal use only”): Compromise of data with this sensitivity label could cause minor disruptions, delays or impacts.
        - Unrestricted public data: As this data is already published, no harm can come from further dissemination or disclosure.
    - 2 or 3 classification are manageable, >4 is difficult
- Retention - Information and data should be kept only for as long as it is beneficial, no more and no less
    - certain industry standards, laws and regulations define retention periods
    - Records retention - indicate how long an organization is required to maintain information and assets
    - it should guarantee:
        - Personnel understand the various retention requirements for data of different types throughout the organization.
        - The organization appropriately documents the retention requirements for each type of information.
        - The systems, processes and individuals of the organization retain information in accordance with the required schedule but no longer.
- Destruction
    - remanence - Data that might be left on media after deleting
    - steps to reduce risk data remanence:
        - Clearing the device or system, which usually involves writing multiple patterns of random values throughout all storage media (such as main memory, registers and fixed disks). This is sometimes called “overwriting” or “zeroizing” the system, although writing zeros has the risk that a missed block or storage extent may still contain recoverable, sensitive information after the process is completed.
        - Purging the device or system, which eliminates (or greatly reduces) the chance that residual physical effects from the writing of the original data values may still be recovered, even after the system is cleared. Some magnetic disk storage technologies, for example, can still have residual “ghosts” of data on their surfaces even after being overwritten multiple times. Magnetic media, for example, can often be altered sufficiently to meet security requirements; in more stringent cases, **[degaussing](https://learn.isc2.org/content/enforced/9541-CC-SPT-GLOBAL-1ED-1M/build/chapter_05/module_01/ch05_m01-Data_Handling_Practices.html?ou=9541&d2l_body_type=3#)** may not be sufficient.
        - Physical destruction of the device or system is the ultimate remedy to data remanence. Magnetic or optical disks and some flash drive technologies may require being mechanically shredded, chopped or broken up, etched in acid or burned; their remains may be buried in protected landfills, in some cases.

### ****Logging and Monitoring Security Events****

- Logging - the primary form of instrumentation that attempts to capture signals generated by events
- information that relevant to be record:
    - user IDs
    - system activities
    - dates/times of key events (e.g., logon and logoff)
    - device and location identity
    - successful and rejected system and resource access attempts
    - system configuration changes and system protection activation and deactivation events

### Event Logging Best Practices

- Ingress monitoring - refers to surveillance and assessment of all inbound communications traffic and access attempts
    - tools include:
        - Firewalls
        - Gateways
        - Remote authentication servers
        - IDS/IPS tools
        - SIEM solutions
        - Anti-malware solutions
- Egrass monitoring - used to regulate data leaving the organization’s IT environment
- term used for data loss prevention (DLP) or data leak protection
- DLP solution can inspect data leaving the organization such as:
    - Email (content and attachments)
    - Copy to portable media
    - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
    - Posting to web pages/websites
    - Applications/application programming interfaces (APIs)

### Encryption  Overview

- Encryption - process or act of converting plaintext to cipher (rubbish) text
- can help achieve required systems security postures in many ways:
    - Confidentiality: Cryptography provides confidentiality by hiding or obscuring a message so that it cannot be understood by anyone except the intended recipient. Confidentiality keeps information secret from those who are not authorized to have it.
    - Integrity: **hash functions** and **digital signatures** can provide integrity services that allow a recipient to verify that a message has not been altered by malice or error. These include simple message integrity controls. Any changes, deliberate or accidental, will result in the two results (by sender and by recipient) being different.
