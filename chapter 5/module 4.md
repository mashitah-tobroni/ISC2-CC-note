# Module 4: Understand Security Awareness Training

### Purpose

- to make sure everyone knows what is expected of them, based on responsibilities and accountabilities, and to find out if there is any carelessness or complacency that may pose a risk to the organization
- three different types of learning activity;
    - **Education**: The overall goal of education is to help learners improve their understanding of these ideas and their ability to relate them to their own experiences and apply that learning in useful ways.
    - **Training**: Focuses on building proficiency in a specific set of skills or actions, including sharpening the perception and judgment needed to make decisions as to which skill to use, when to use it and how to apply it. Training can focus on low-level skills, an entire task or complex workflows consisting of many tasks.
    - **Awareness**: These are activities that attract and engage the learnerâ€™s attention by acquainting them with aspects of an issue, concern, problem or need.

quick meme:

Did you know if you have a 10-number password, then with software with the cryptographic calculation to brute force attack your environment, it will take 5 seconds to crack

Most people thing 8 characters password pretty secure already but the thing is its only take 35 days to crack.

So how much characters the best for our password? Its 16 characters with upper and lowercase characters and special characters that will take about 152k years to crack
